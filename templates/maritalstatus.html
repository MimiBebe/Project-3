    <p>Of all the loan applicants in our model, 64.8% were married, while 35.2% were not.<br>
        As you can see from the loan approval chart, loan applicants who were married were approved at a noticably higher rate.<br>
        Typically (but not in all cases) people who are married may have dual incomes, which results in making more money, which may factor into why the loan approval rate was higher for these applicants.</p>
