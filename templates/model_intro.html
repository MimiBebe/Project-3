                                <h2><strong>Prediction Model Exploration</strong></h2>
                                <p class="text-justify">Five types of model were tested: Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forests, 
                                    and Neural Networks. <br><br>
                                    Within each, several different factor combinations were tried: <br><br>
                                    -- Income was treated as Total Income, as separate terms for Applicant and Co-Applicant Income, or as log(Total Income).<br><br>
                                    -- Because we do not know what Loan Amounts or Loan Terms the applicants in the training dataset requested vs. what they received, and an applicant 
                                    requesting too large a loan might be denied despite otherwise favorable attributes, some models were tested both with and 
                                    without these terms. A log transformation of Loan Amount was also tried.<br><br>
                                    -- The Random Forest runs found several terms (Gender, Education, Self_Employed, Married) of consistently low importance, 
                                    so some of the other models were tested both with and without this set.<br><br>
                                Factors specific to particular model types were also varied, discussed on their separate pages.<br><br>
                                Overall, most test accuracies were in the range of 0.7 - 0.8, and income and credit score were the primary deciding factors. The Random Forest method
                                identifed three sets of variables, in decreasing order of importance: Income, Credit Rating, and Loan Amount; Dependents, Property Area, and Loan Term; and 
                                Married, Education, Gender, and Self-Employed. Removing these last four from the analysis generally decreased the accuracy of Random Forest and KNN runs,
                                but increased it for Neural Networks and Decision Trees (not tested on the Logistic Regression model). This may reflect overtraining of some models on the training split.
                                 <br><br>
                                The highest accuracies found so far are:<br><br>
