                                <p class="text-justify">*** different types of models were tested: Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forests, 
                                    and Neural Networks. <br>
                                    Within each, several different factor combinations were tried: <br><br>
                                    -- Income was treated as Total Income, as separate terms for Applicant and Co-Applicant Income, and/or as log(Total Income).<br><br>
                                    -- Because we do not know what Loan Amounts or Loan Terms the applicants requested vs. what they received, and an applicant 
                                    requesting too large a loan might be denied despite otherwise favorable attributes, some models were tested both with and 
                                    without these terms. <br><br>
                                    -- The Random Forest runs found several terms (Gender, Education, Self_Employed, Married) of consistently low importance, 
                                    so some of the other models were tested both with and without this set.<br><br>
                                Factors specific to some of the different model types were also varied, discussed below.<br><br>
                                Overall, most test accuracies were in the range of 0.7 - 0.8, and income and credit score were the primary deciding variables.
                                 Including more terms or longer model runs did not necessarily improve accuracy; this could be an example of "overtraining", 
                                 with models too well adjusted to the training subset to work well on the test subset.
